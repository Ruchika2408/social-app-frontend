                        We are a group of 10 people working on this project. The companyâ€™s
                        vision is to raise awareness of social issues and give our users a
                        platform where they can advertise for small businesses. This web
                        application will allow users to create and participate in the
                        causes that are close to their hearts and also provide a platform
                        for small business owners to promote their businesses and get
                        leads.
